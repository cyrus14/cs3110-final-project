  This project simulates the game of the same name, released by Greenhart Games 
  in 2012. The player takes on the role of an indie game developer working from 
  their garage in the early 1980s, where they can choose the features of the 
  first small games that they develop. They can choose things such as the 
  platform to build the game on, the genre of the game, and which features 
  to invest more resources into (level design vs. engine). They then will 
  earn reviews and the amount of revenue earned will be based on how well 
  they chose a strong fit for all the different features (i.e. PC platform 
  and MMO genre is a strong fit). As the player progresses through the game 
  and earns more revenue, they can expand their development studio, allowing 
  for larger projects with more advanced features. As they progress, time will 
  also pass in the game so more modern platforms and technologies will be 
  unlocked (i.e. N64 platform and 3D games unlock in 1996, Xbox One platform 
  and 4K graphics unlock in 2013).
